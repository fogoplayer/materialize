It's material design, but cooler.

A fork of MaterializeCSS (materializecss.com)

## Things to know

Darkest elements (navbar) are #000
Background is #333
Intermediate elements are #222
Accent color is #118591, though should probably be changed to a brighter, almost electric blue

Making my way through the test suite, I am currently on badges.html

I need to take a closer clook at scrollfire and scrollspy to figure out what they are doing.

Before running second round of tests, remove all color modifiers.
